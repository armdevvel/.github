# Project Rakko
Project Rakko is a project dedicated to making as many useful programs and libraries run on Windows on ARM32 (Windows RT / Windows 10 on ARM32). We use [LLVM-MinGW](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) to port applications. The icon is drawn by [@p4ckles](https://twitter.com/p4ckles) on Twitter

## Applications and Libraries
Most applications, libraries, and resources released by the team are put on [my website](https://download.pahaze.net/ARM/), as well as multiple other mirrors (check [MIRRORS.md](https://github.com/armdevvel/.github/blob/master/MIRRORS.md)). A list of working libraries is still being worked on, but for working libraries that are able to be compiled with our MXE environment, go check ["unstable" MXE's](https://github.com/armdevvel/mxe-UNSTABLE/blob/master/WORKING-LIBRARIES.md) list.

## Joining the Team
Joining the team is easy! All you have to do is create an issue (or discussion) on a repo (MXE, preferably) or email me (pahaze@pahaze.net). 2FA is ***REQUIRED*** to join the team so we can keep the organization safe :).
