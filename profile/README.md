# Project Rakko
Project Rakko is a project dedicated to making as many useful programs and libraries run on Windows on ARM32 (Windows RT / Windows 10 on ARM32). We use [LLVM-MinGW](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) to port applications. The icon is drawn by [@p4ckles](https://twitter.com/p4ckles) on Twitter

## Applications and Libraries
Most applications, libraries, and resources released by the team are put on [my website](https://download.pahaze.net/ARM/), as well as multiple other mirrors (check [MIRRORS.md](https://github.com/armdevvel/.github/blob/master/MIRRORS.md)). A list of working libraries is still being worked on, but for working libraries that are able to be compiled with our MXE environment, go check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z3FsGSXh3eOh3D9pcrw8rqQk3W11A8DudYqaO8XoQF0/edit?usp=sharing). It's constantly updated when we make edits to [MXE (shared)](https://github.com/armdevvel/mxe-SHARED)!

## Joining the Team
Joining the team is easy! All you have to do is create an issue (or discussion) on a repo (MXE, preferably) or email me (lumier@fryelum.dev). 2FA is ***REQUIRED*** to join the team so we can keep the organization safe :).
