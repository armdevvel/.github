# Project Rakko
Project Rakko is a project dedicated to making as many useful programs and libraries run on Windows on ARM32 (Windows RT / Windows 10 on ARM32). We use [LLVM-MinGW](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) to port applications.

## Applications and Libraries
Most applications ported by the team are put on [my website](https://download.pahaze.net/ARM/), but I have plans to upload to Google Drive and other sites. A list of working libraries is still being worked on, but for working libraries that are able to be compiled with our MXE environment, go check ["unstable" MXE's](https://github.com/armdevvel/mxe-UNSTABLE/blob/master/WORKING-LIBRARIES.md) list.

## Joining the Team
Joining the team is easy! All you have to do is create an issue (or discussion) on a repo (MXE, preferably) or email me (pahaze200@protonmail.com). 2FA is ***REQUIRED*** to join the team so we can keep the organization verified :).
